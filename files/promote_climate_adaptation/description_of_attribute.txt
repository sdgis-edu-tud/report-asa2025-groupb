data used:
processing method:
source of flood data: Margarita Choulga; Francesca Moschini; Cinzia Mazzetti; Grimaldi, Stefania; Disperati, Juliana; Beck, Hylke; Salamon, Peter; Prudhomme, Christel (2023): LISFLOOD static and parameter maps for Europe.

name of attribute: river_sinuosity
description of attribute: the winding, curving path of a river, quantified by a ratio of the river's actual length to the straight-line distance between its source and mouth
data used: OSM_waterways
processing method: 
	Dissolve waterways
	Intersect Dissolved waterways with grid
	Multipart to Singlepart ( Geometry validity )
	Calculate length ( length ) ( length along geometry)
	Calculate distance ( distance(start_point($geometry), end_point($geometry)) ) ( euclidian distance between start and end point )
	Create centroids of waterways ( increase accuracy in calculation )
	Join attributes by location ( summary )
	Calculate sinuosity ( length(sum)/distance(sum) )

	Calculate weighted sum sinuosity:
		weighted_sum = Σ (sinuosity_i * length_i)
		total_length = Σ length_i
		mean_sinuosity = weighted_sum / total_length
