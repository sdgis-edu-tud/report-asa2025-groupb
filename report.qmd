## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}

## Introduction

In this course, we explored urban stream restoration in PoznaÅ„, Poland, using two primary methodological approaches: Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Typology Construction. For each method, we identified relevant objectives and formulated research questions tailored to the respective analytical framework. In the case of MCDA, the selection of criteria and the rationale behind their inclusion will be detailed in the *Methods* section, while the corresponding analytical outcomes will be presented in the *Results* section.

### MCDA

#### GOAL

-   **Urban Stream Restoration**: building a more resilient urban environmental system

#### OBJECTIVES AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS

-   **Enrich Biodiversity**: Which areas have a good base for implementing nature-based restoration solutions that nurture better biodiversity?

-   **Promote Climate Adaptation**: Which areas are most in need of interventions to promote climate adaptation?

-   **Improve Quality of Life**: Which areas are most suitable for neighborhood-oriented interventions that improve the quality of life of local residents?

### Typology Construction

#### GOAL

-   *to be updated*

#### OBJECTIVES AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS

-   *to be updated*

## Roles and Explanations

-   **Stepan: Data analyst**\
    Data analyst and Presentation lead.
-   **Roger: Landscape architect**\
    Landscape expert and Mapping
-   **Yaying: Mapping and Design**\
    Data visualization and Mapping.
-   **Jaee: Research Lead**\
    Oversees background research

## Research Background

**What is the Context of Stream Restoration in Poznan?**

1.  Streams go through multiple land use/typology: ***need to choose the suitable restoration strategy based on specific context*** ![](report_files/libs/imgs/0-1_poznan_satellite_map.jpeg)\
2.  Streams end up in Warta River Valley: ***River Warta included in the research together with the stream system*** ![](report_files/libs/imgs/0-2_topography.jpeg)\

## Methods

*In the Methods section, describe what are the the spatial unit (and the rationale), the indicators you choose and why, the workflow of MCDA, and later the typology construction. (from comment)*

### MCDA

#### MCDA Structure

#### Grid Division: Why Hexagon Grid and What are the Parameters? ![](report_files/libs/imgs/1-3_full_grid.jpeg)

**Hexagons**:\
- Equal distance to neighboring cells\
- Reduced edge effect\
**Diameter = 500m**:\
- 5-10min walk distance\
- Integrate stream restoration intervention into urban life in the vicinity\
- Reasonable amount of cells in the whole city area\

![](report_files/libs/imgs/1-4_buffer.jpeg)\

**Buffer Zone = 300m**:\
- Potential area under the influence of the streams for local residents\
- Suitable for collecting relevant context information

#### Indicators and Argumentation

1.  **Enrich Biodiversity**\
    1-1. Healthy Vegetation Density\
    1-2. Natural Land Use Density\
    1-3. Species Richness\
    1-4. Nuisance from Industries\

2.  **Promote Climate Adaptation**\

3.  **Improve Quality of Life**\
