## This is a computational notebook

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

You can delete this entire callout between and including the lines

```

## Introduction

## Roles and Explanations

-   **Stepan: Data analyst**\
    Data analyst and Presentation lead.
-   **Roger: Landscape architect**\
    Landscape expert and Mapping
-   **Yaying: Mapping and Design**\
    Data visualization and Mapping.
-   **Jaee: Research Lead**\
    Oversees background research

## Research Background

**What is the Context of Stream Restoration in Poznan?**

1.  Streams go through multiple land use/typology: ***need to choose the suitable restoration strategy based on specific context***

(placeholder for image0-1)

2.  Streams end up in Warta River Valley: ***River Warta included in the research together with the stream system***

## Methods

### MCDA

#### GOAL

-   **Urban Stream Restoration**: building a more resilient urban environmental system

#### OBJECTIVES AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS

-   **Enrich Biodiversity**: Which areas have a good base for implementing nature-based restoration solutions that nurture better biodiversity?

-   **Promote Climate Adaptation**: Which areas are most in need of interventions to promote climate adaptation?

-   **Improve Quality of Life**: Which areas are most suitable for neighborhood-oriented interventions that improve the quality of life of local residents?

#### Methodology
